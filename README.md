# Face-Mask-Detection

The system successfully detects whether individuals are wearing face masks in real time using a webcam. It accurately identifies faces, classifies mask status, and displays colored bounding boxes with labels ("Mask" or "No Mask") on the video feed. The model performs efficiently with high accuracy and can be deployed on both local machines and edge devices for live monitoring.
